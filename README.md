# angular-webworker-playground

Playground for seeing `platform-webworker` from Angular in action

This project is a typical Angular CLI built application, with a few additions:
* `src/lib/*` folders for different platforms.
* Scripts and entry points for all 3 platform types: browser, server, and webworker:
`npm/yarn start`, `npm/yarn run start-server`, and `npm/yarn run start-webworker`

# TODO

* Add ng-bootstrap dropdown component, fixed for webworkers
